This is the source code of the Serverless `Todos` service.

You'll find two directories here.

The [backend](backend) directory contains the whole Serverless service and it's corresponding function code.
To deploy and use this applications do the following:

1. `cd` into the `backend` directory
2. Run `npm install` to install the used npm packages
3. Run `serverless deploy` to deploy the Serverless service to AWS

The [frontend](frontend) directory contains the different frontends you can connect to your backend to use the Todos service through your web browser.
