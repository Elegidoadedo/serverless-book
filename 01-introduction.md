# Introduction
Hello and welcome to the Serverless book!

In this book we'll discover the Serverless framework. It's a very powerful, yet easy to use developer tool to build modern, monstrously scalable web applications with the help of [FaaS](xx-terminologies.md#faas) (function as a service) offerings from the cloud provider of your choice.

We'll start this book by looking into the serverless architecture in general. Questions like "What is the serverless architecture?", "Why does it make software development easier?" or "Why should I care and jump on the Serverless train?" will be answered in this chapter.

After that we talk about the [Serverless framework](http://serverless.com). What is the motivation of the Serverless framework, why was it developed and how does it work?

With this foundation we'll create a first Serverless [service](xx-terminologies.md#service). This service will live through the whole, usual service lifecycle. We'll create it, deploy it, invoke a function from it, update the functions code, redeploy it and remove it. Furthermore we'll look into the configuration files of the Serverless framework to see how we can simply extend our service with e.g. other event sources (such as HTTP).
