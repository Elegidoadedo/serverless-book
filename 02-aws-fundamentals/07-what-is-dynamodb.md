# What is DynamoDB?

[DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) is a NoSQL database service with nearly infinite scalability and flexibility.

NoSQL means that you don't have to specify a schema which declares what kind of data you store (like you would do when you use a relational database). You simply create a table which should hold your data and store the data.

With DynamoDB you can store key-value or document based data inside those tables.

## How Serverless uses DynamoDB

DynamoDB is not used per default in Serverless. However we'll use DynamoDB in upcoming projects as our main database.
