# Serverless by example

Now that we've seen how easy it is to create, deploy and manage our own Serverless service we'd like to dig deeper into the world of the Serverless framework and build real world, event driven applications.

These chapters are meant to show you the full power of Serverless. We'll build example applications for different  use cases. This way you'll see that the Serverless framework is a great tool to achieve different goals / work in different environments. The number of different things you can build with Serverless is endless.

Serverless is not only restricted to build web applications or data processing pipelines. Basically everything which can fire an event can trigger your function to execute code you wrote which means that the stuff you can build is only restricted by your imagination!

Let's start with our very first application!

Our first application is a web application. We'll create a simple note taking application in JavaScript / Node.js and deploy it to AWS. Excited and ready? Let's go!
